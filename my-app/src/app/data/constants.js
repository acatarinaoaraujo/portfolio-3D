    date: "Jun 2024",
    journal: "Thesis Accepted: Master of Science in Computer Science",
    description:
      "This study addresses the challenge of accurately classifying software vulnerabilities, critical weaknesses that can endanger system security. Leveraging the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the Vulnerability Description Ontology from NIST, we explore the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BERT and DistilBERT, to enhance classification across 27 vulnerability categories. Our analysis shows that LLMs outperform traditional models and entropy-based methods, particularly in understanding vulnerability descriptions within specified noun groups. Additionally, the ml highlights that while expanding datasets can improve classification coverage, annotation quality remains a key factor. The findings underscore the potential of LLMs and well-curated data to improve automated vulnerability assessment, advancing cybersecurity practices and precision in vulnerability management.",

    description:
      "This study examines the security practices and challenges faced by mobile app developers. As mobile apps increasingly handle sensitive data for essential services like banking and healthcare, securing them is critical. Through a global survey of 137 experienced mobile developers, our research provides insights into the practices developers prioritize, such as authentication and secure storage, and the obstacles they encounter, including managing vulnerabilities, permissions, and privacy concerns. The findings highlight a gap in existing resources, with many developers expressing a need for improved training and practical guidance on secure development. Developers often rely on platforms like Stack Overflow for security-related information but report that current learning materials fall short in equipping them with comprehensive security skills. This research underscores the need for better-designed tools, resources, and training programs that integrate security from the earliest stages of development, contributing to a safer mobile app ecosystem.",

The existing system lacked a centralized database, making it difficult to track and analyze debris trends, with data scattered across Google Drives, Access databases, and Excel spreadsheets. Makai introduced a mobile-friendly platform with a centralized database for debris reports, accessible to both the public and debris removal organizations. This solution enables researchers to monitor debris types and hotspots while streamlining the reporting process. The platform aims to positively impact Hawaii in four areas. First, it contributes to preserving marine ecosystems by facilitating debris removal. Second, it encourages community engagement by raising environmental awareness. Third, it provides data visualizations that empower policymakers, environmental agencies, and researchers to make informed decisions about conservation strategies. Lastly, it helps debris removal organizations optimize resource allocation, making the process more efficient.",

    title: "Coffee Leaf Disease Diagnoser",
    date: "Jan 2023 - Apr 2023",
    description: "This project tackled the challenge of identifying and quantifying diseases and pests in Brazilian Arabica coffee plants using advanced deep learning techniques. The focus was on leveraging the BRACOL dataset, a specialized collection of coffee leaf images, to classify five conditions: healthy, miner, rust, phoma, and cercospora. Early detection and accurate classification of these diseases can significantly improve coffee production by reducing losses and enhancing sustainability. To achieve this, a fine-tuned ResNeXt50_32x4d model was employed, chosen for its robustness in handling complex image classification tasks. Key methodologies included data augmentation to enhance dataset diversity, hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy, and employing adaptive learning rate strategies with the CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts scheduler. This approach enabled the model to achieve high accuracy while maintaining scalability.",
